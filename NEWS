CHANGES IN VERSION 1.57.1
------------------------
NEW FEATURES

    o Includes code from Vishak Venkateswaran's branch of SBMLR on github (July 2011).
      This is may allow it to read more models in http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/


SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o SBMLR model files no longer need to have the reversible flag set. The default is FALSE, 
      which is the opposite of Level 2: all of my reaction rate laws have always been positive,
      and a design objective I like is to keep SBMLR model files as lean as possible (subject to 
      the constraint that they be valid R code). 

    o Simulate handles lsoda() event dataframes, see simulate help. 

    o curtoNatural.R (see Fig. 7 BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:190) is now in the models folder. 

    o The SOD model of Kowald et al, JTB 238 (2006) 828â€“840 is now also in this folder. 

Notes

    o Internal S3 SBML objects do need to have their reversible flag set. The assumption of a 
      FALSE default is thus strictly between this S3 object and the SBMLR file specification. We
      are not trying to keep the internal R object pretty/simple.

    o TODO: preserve layout info

    o TODO: convert rsbml S4 objects to SBMLR S3 objects
